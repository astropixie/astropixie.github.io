  "body": "I am a Research Astronomer and Outreach Officer at the [Australian Astronomical Observatory](https://www.aao.gov.au/) (AAO) based in Sydney, Australia. \r\n\r\n### Research \r\nI explore variations in how galaxies form, how they live their lives, and how they evolve into the diverse array of galaxy species we see today.  I use surveys with thousands or hundreds of thousands of galaxies, like the [GAMA Survey](http://www.gama-survey.org/) and the [SAMI Galaxy Survey](http://sami-survey.org/), to investigate what physical processes regulate star formation inside galaxies that live in different cosmic environments.\r\n\r\n### Outreach and Science Communication \r\nIn early 2015 I was named one of Australia's [\"Top 5 Under 40\"] (http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/scienceshow/top-5-under-40-winners-announced/6282910) science researchers and communicators and received the Australian Institute of Physics NSW _Community Outreach to Physics Award_ in November. I was also a finalist in the national Fresh Science Media competition.  I'm working to develop strategies to capture and communicate the excitement of new astronomical discoveries and innovative engineering feats occurring within the AAO and the astronomical community. \r\n \r\nI am a committee member of the Astronomical Society of Australia (ASA) Education and Public Outreach Chapter (EPOC) and co-chaired the Australian Astronomy Decadal Plan Working Group 3.2 on Education, Outreach, and Careers.  \r\n\r\n### Contact \r\nAmanda Bauer  \r\nc/o Australian Astronomical Observatory  \r\nPO Box 915  \r\nNorth Ryde, NSW 1670  \r\nAUSTRALIA  \r\n\r\n\r\namanda.bauer AT aao.gov.au  \r\ntwitter : [@astropixie](https://twitter.com/astropixie)  \r\n[blog](http://amandabauer.blogspot.com.au/)",
